ml-laboratory
==============================

My playground for machine learning tests.

> Be aware that most of the code is not complete and might not work as expected.


Preparing the environment
-------------------------

To install `poetry` and the project dependencies, run

```bash
$ make deps
```


Executing the code
------------------

 
Make sure you activate the correct environment before executing any script/notebook. 

```bash
$ poetry shell
```

Alternatively, run everything prefixing with `poetry run`.
