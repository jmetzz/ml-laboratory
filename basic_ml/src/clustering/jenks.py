# The Jenks optimization method (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenks_natural_breaks_optimization),
# also called the Jenks natural breaks classification method,
# is a data clustering method designed to determine the best arrangement of values into different classes.
# This is done by seeking to minimize each class's average deviation from the class mean, while maximizing each class's
# deviation from the means of the other groups. In other words, the method seeks to reduce the variance within classes and maximize the variance between classes.
